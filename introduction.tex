General introduction. Introduction to topic addressed in the journal.
Review of the State of the Art. Specify why our approach has benefits
and which are they. Indicate contributions.

Our work is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:testbed} introduces
the testbed system, its setup, connectivity, files configuration and
compilation of the Kodo library. Section \ref{sec:schemes} defines the
coding schemes employed in our study. Later, in Section \ref{sec:metrics}
we describe the considered metrics for performance comparison of the
codes deployed in the Raspberry Pi. In Section \ref{sec:measurements}, we show
the measurements in the Raspberry Pi of the mentioned metrics. Final
conclusions and future work are reviewed in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.


%The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications should be cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the main conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research.
